    "### 1 Overview  \n",
    "In the modern insurance industry, personalized marketing and targeted offerings have become key to improving customer engagement, retention, and profitability.Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on certain characteristics, behaviors, or needs. These segments can then be targeted with tailored marketing campaigns, products, and services that are more relevant to each group. By understanding and leveraging customer segments, insurance companies can better meet customer expectations, optimize pricing strategies, and improve overall customer satisfaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to explore and implement customer segmentation techniques using machine learning to segment insurance customers based on their attributes such as age, sex, smoking status, region, and insurance charges. The ultimate goal is to help insurance companies refine their marketing strategies, deliver personalized experiences, and enhance customer acquisition and retention."

    "Insurance companies often face the challenge of providing personalized experiences to a diverse customer base. Without an understanding of different customer profiles, they might struggle to offer relevant policies, products, or services. This leads to missed opportunities for cross-selling, upselling, and customer retention. A one-unit approach to marketing may not be effective in addressing the distinct needs of various customer segments.\n",

    "1. How can we segment insurance customers into meaningful groups based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics?\n",
